# Arsfetch

----

Hello, I'm ars, I'll tell you that to test my fetch you need the following libraries:

- platform
- psutil
- OS Module
- datetime
- cpuinfo
 shellingham


You can install the libraries with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
pip3 install psutil
pip3 install py-cpuinfo
pip3 install shellingham
```
or:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3 -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some modules come pre-installed with Python, such as the platform module, os, and the datetime module, so there's no need to install them.

I hope you enjoy my fetch and support this low-level developer in their projects, I will update it soon! Goodbye!
