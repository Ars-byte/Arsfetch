Hello, I'm ars, I'll tell you that to test my fetch you need the following libraries:

platform
psutil
OS Module
datetime
cpuinfo
shellingham


You can install the libraries with the following commands:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install psutil
pip3 install py-cpuinfo
pip3 install shellingham

Some modules come pre-installed with Python, such as the platform module, os, and the datetime module, so there's no need to install them.

I hope you enjoy my fetch and support this low-level developer in their projects, I will update it soon! Goodbye!
